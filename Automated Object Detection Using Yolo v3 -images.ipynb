    "In this notebook I will be using the powerful YOLOv3 model to detect objects. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the YOLO v3 paper: Redmon et al., 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767). THe particular model I will be using is YOLO trained on the COCO dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe COCO dataset consits of 80 labels, including, but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People\n",
    "* Bicycles\n",
    "* Cars and Trucks\n",
    "* Airplanes\n",
    "* Stop Signs and Fire Hydrants\n",

    "- Use object detection on a car detection dataset\n",
    "- Deal with bounding boxes\n",
    "- Use object dection on various objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Accomplish This:\n",
    "1. Define path to image we will train on and configuration files relevant to YOLO model (This step requires user input)\n",
    "2. Define Labels, colors for bounding boxes, and load YOLOv3 along with it's pretrained weights\n",

    "4. Calculate object bounding boxes\n",
    "5. Apply non-max suppression to overlapping bounding boxes\n",
