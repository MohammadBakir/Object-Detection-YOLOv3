    "In this notebook I will be using the powerful YOLOv3 model to detect objects. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the YOLO v3 paper: Redmon et al., 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767). THe particular model I will be using is YOLO trained on the COCO dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe COCO dataset consits of 80 labels, including, but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People\n",
    "* Bicycles\n",
    "* Cars and Trucks\n",
    "* Airplanes\n",
    "* Stop Signs and Fire Hydrants\n",
    "* Animals, including cats, dogs, birds, horses, cows, and sheep, to name a few\n",
    "* Kitchen and dining objects, such as wine glasses, cups, forks, knives, spoons, etx. \n",
    "* ...and much more!\n",

    "**Objective**:\n",
    "- Use object detection on a car detection dataset\n",
    "- Deal with bounding boxes\n",
    "- Use object dection on various objects"
